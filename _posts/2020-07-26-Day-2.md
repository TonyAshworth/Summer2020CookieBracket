**Winner: Lemon Oreosssssssss**

Thin Bites: White Fudge Dipped Oreo
- first bite: ok this is interesting. so many flavors at once! very strong on the white fudge coating which makes me think im eating those white fudge pretzels but then oops here comes a chocolate cookie not a pretzel. then back to fudge then cookie again. my mouth is TIRED.
- just cookie: you should all be impressed with my level of dedication as i went and got a knife to do this. ooooo cookie and fudge is lovely. excellent balance.
- just filling: my teeth are too strong and keep breaking the cookie instead of scrapping off the filling. knife to the rescue again. just filling is so smol! just a hint of sugar.
- dipped in beverage: ha this is just weird. it just slides right off the coating. even if I bite it in two theres so little cookie to absorb the milk it doesnt work.
- last bite: the fudge is very very tasty though it tends to overwhelm the cookie underneath. good if you like white fudge (which I do).

Lemon Oreo
- first bite: F*CK YES LEMON COOKIE. this is what Iâ€™m talking about about!
- just cookie: basically a sugar cookie. kinda like a shortbread? maybe? I miss the filling
- just filling: omg I can feeeeel the sugar hit the bloodstream. but it comes on a boat of lemony goodness and so the bloodstream is riding the sunshiney sugar
- dipped in beverage: hmmmm milk is kinda ok? but also it tones down my lemon vibe and that makes me sad. no squishy lemons in my world please.
- last bite: why is the cookie gone?! bring me more cookies!!
