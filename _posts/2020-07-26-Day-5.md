**Winner: Pink Sugar Cookie aka Crack Cookie**

HIT Cocoa Cookie scoring:
- smell:  slight chocolate? very faint smells
- first bite: holy poo this is a crumbly cookie. it’s like everywhere! so dry cookie but good fudgyness in the middle.
- second bite: the cookie explosions are hard to deal with. I’m def eating this over my plate to control the crumbs.
- dipping in beverage: ohhhhh no. the cookie disintegrates in the milk. soggy mess city here.
- last bite: meh. the cocoa middle is great but it is surrounded by exploding cookie. I even tried to cut it open to get at the frosting and it shattered in my hand.
- fingers: so many crumbs. so little time.

Pink Sugar Cookie scoring:
- smell:  sugar bomb. straight to the sinuses.
- first bite: crackcooookiessssssss. zero redeeming qualities other than it is packed with fake suagrs.
- second bite: can feel my teeth rotting in my skull. and also my mother yelling at me to eat real food. or is it this room yelling at me? :thinking_face:
- dipping in beverage: should I be concerned that the cookie will not absorb liquid? it just rolllls right off as though coated in teflon.
- last bite: I think i’m dying from the sugar rush. can that happen? can your heart just vibrate right out of your chest?
- fingers: slightly crumbly as cookie dust sticks to them.
