![]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-17.jpeg)

Winner: Mi-del Ginger Snaps!! Sorry Kate to ruin your streak :(

Shady Maple Farms Stroopwafels scoring:
- smell: if you snorted maple syrup would it clog your nose? asking for a friend
- first bite:  very very chewy maple syrup with a kinda dry overtone to it? its very crumbly everywhere
- second bite: heating up over my coffee does warm up the syrupiness but then it also gets bendy. which is bizarre for a cookie.
- dipping in beverage: this is what stroopwafles were made for, dipping in coffee is golden
last bite: they have perfected a way to eat syrup in handheld form.
- fingers: so very dusty with crumbs, must eat over plate and brush off fingers regularly

Mi-del Ginger Snaps scoring:
- smell: tons of ginger with a slight cardamony vibe? smells like winter.
- first bite:  crunch city! very very crunchy cookies with an excellent spice combo. the ginger is intense on the backend.
- second bite: nomnomnom excellent spice cookie, excellent crunch. it could be a smidge less hard but im still digging it.
- dipping in beverage: just slightly starts to soften which is lovely. though dont hold under too long or it goes too far.
- last bite: it’s a bit odd to eat these when it’s 80 degrees outside but I do not care. bring on the spicy snaps!
- fingers: slight dust but the hardness of the cookie does help keep fingers clean
