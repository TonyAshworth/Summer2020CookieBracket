**Winner: Chocolate Marshmallow Oreo. No fudge face please.**

Dark Chocolate Oreo scoring
- first bite: ok so it feels pretty standard to a normal oreo until the last few seconds when it is just the filling. and oh boy, very chocolately on the filling. I am all chocolate now.
- just cookie: standard choco cookie. I know it doesn’t taste more like chocolate and yet my brain wants to say it is.
- just filling: ok I feel I need to stop putting the WHOLE FILLING in my mouth at once. I need a bucket of milk, this is very very very fudgey in your face.
- dipped in beverage: milk is actually pretty needed here. anything to tone down the fudge face.
- last bite: DO YOU LOVE CHOCOLATE FUDGE?? if so, have I got a cookie for you!

Chocolate Marshmallow Oreoscoring
- first bite: YO this is a marshmallow! I had no idea! its so weirddddddd. it even smells like a marshmallow. but a chocolately one? how do you do that oreo?!
- just cookie: now this tastes like a less chocolately cookie. my mouth is broken.
- just filling: ok now it tastes less like a marshmallow! slightly marshmallowy? im so confused y’all. what if I can never taste food correctly again?!
- dipped in beverage: milk is ok? it doesn’t really need it and it makes it soggy and I don’t like soggy.
- last bite: by the time i’m done it doesn’t taste as much like marshmallows as the first bite. less s’more, if you will  However, it is actually a more balanced cookie and I do not need to chug milk.
