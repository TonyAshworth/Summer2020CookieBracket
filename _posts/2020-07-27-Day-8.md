![day-8.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-8.jpg)

**Winner: Thin Bites: Fudge Dipped Mint Oreo. IT’S A THIN MINT Y’ALL.**

Thin Bites: Fudge Dipped Oreo
- smells: basic chocolate fudge smells
- first bite: weirddd this one tastes very much liek chocolate only. where is the middle cream filling?!
- just cookie: double basic choco flavor
- just filling:  tiny little cream filling makes sense why it’s so hard to taste in the full cookie bite.
- dipped in beverage: poor fudge dipped gets no milk love
- last bite: this is an unbalaced oreo. the fuge outside doubles down on the chocolate and not enough middle cream. we needed an OG double stuffed to help here.
- fingers: dirty chocolately fingers, especially if you keep holding it trying to pry it apart.

Thin Bites: Fudge Dipped Mint Oreo
- smells: oooooo it smells like a Thin Mint! I’m excited!
- first bite: f*ck yes it tastes like a thin mint! with just a hint of the cream in the middle.
- just cookie: ya basic choco flavor
- just filling: too little minty goodness
- dipped in beverage: not enough cookie to absorb the milk. fudge coating makes it all just run away.
- last bite: thin mints in mini form available all. year. long.
- fingers: this shiz melts in your hand AND your mouth. be warned clean fingers fanatics.
