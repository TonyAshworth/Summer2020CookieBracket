![day-14.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-14.jpg)

Winner: Peanut Butter Oreo? It’s the only one with some redeeming qualities.

Olympic Oreo scoring:
- smells: normal oreo? mostly smells like sugar
- first bite: nope it tastes different. it’s more sugary than the normal filling. like intensely sugar. like intensely fake sugar syrup.
- just cookie: ok thank god this a normal oreo cookie. it exists. I remembered correctly.
- just filling:  ok so I don’t know how this is possible but it is too sugary for the creme filling. it’s gritty, I can feel the sugar granules in it, maybe? I dunno. A LOT is happening right now.
- dipped in beverage: oh god the insides turn to liquid when subjected to more liquid. what is happening?!
- last bite: way way way too sugary here. it completely overwhelms the cookie so all you are eating is extra gritty sugary frosting.

Peanut Butter Oreo scoring:
- smells: just snorting peanut butter over here
- first bite: ok strong PB happening and not sure I can taste the cookie? only PB? but it can’t be only PB, that’s too much PB. very confused.
- just cookie: ok so… I dont know if the cookie tastes like chocolate anymore. I know it should, but I dont think it does. I’m gonna eat another one. no…. still not sure it has chocolate in the cookie.
- just filling:  spooning up PB from the jar. I mean its sugary PB, but basically PB.
- dipped in beverage: no gross, do not like. this does not need more flavors happening.
- last bite: way way way too much PB here. it completely overwhelms the cookie so all you are eating is PB.
