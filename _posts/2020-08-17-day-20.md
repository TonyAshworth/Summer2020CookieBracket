![day-20.jpeg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-20.jpeg)

Winner: S’moreos!

Chocolate Marshmallow scoring:
- smells: it’s a little bit marshmallow? it smells like sweet sugar which makes no sense but maybe like cotton candy? no…. just sweet sugar. i’m sticking to my words. sweet cream sugar?
- first bite: it’s so weird y’all that this is a smores but with oreo cookies instead of graham crackers. also I feel the cookie is softer? thicker? I dunno my mouth is broken but SO HAPPY!
- just cookie: nope can confirm cookie is harder than normal. which is odd.
- just filling:  it’s a chocolate marshmallow! how is this possible?! those krafty elves are trickers
- dipped in beverage: no wont. can’t make me.
- last bite:  I will live to regret this as they will most certainly kill me, but you win marshmallows!

Fudge Dipped Mint scoring:
- smells: oooooooo yes thin mints here we come
- first bite: YAS THIN MINTS ARE HERE and they are so tasty
- just cookie: thin wafer of cookie and fudge coating. I think the fudge tastes a bit like mint?
- just filling:  just slightly minty which is weird, is the mint more in the cookie itself?
- dipped in beverage: no, I refuse
- last bite:  I do love these but I also have Mint oreos in the bracket and I like the full version better. goodbye sweet minty chocolate
