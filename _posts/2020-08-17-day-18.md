![day-18.jpeg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-18.jpeg)

Winner: Lemon Oreos! I am sad to see you go carrot cake. Maybe my neighbors don’t deserve you.

Carrot Cake Oreo scoring:
- smells: oh yeah thats the stuff. carrot cake spices with a hint of frosting
- first bite: solid cookie spice vibe with a bam mouthful of creamy frosting. portable carrot cakes please!
- just cookie: a harder cookie which is a bit odd, but the flavor is legit. I would eat just the cookie forever.
- just filling:  ok the filling alone is intense. its actually too much sugar frosting than I would prefer. needs cookies.
- dipped in beverage: just no. stop making me ruin perfectly good oreos with milk.
- last bite:  hard choice y’all but ultimately it has too much sugary frosting that overwhelms the excellent cookie.

Lemon Oreo scoring:
- smells: LSD will henceforth be known as Lemons in the Sky with Diamonds! bring me that sweet sweet lemony smell
- first bite: yasssss lemon cookies. sweet with just a hint of lemon tang. me love.
- just cookie: fairly simple sugar cookie by itself
- just filling:  oh yes, that hits the tastebuds like a lemon freight train. 
- dipped in beverage: no milk. I refuse. YOU CANT MAKE ME
- last bite: an excellent sweet and tart combo. I will bring a bucket of these on my road trip and I will ride that lemon sugar high for hourssssss
