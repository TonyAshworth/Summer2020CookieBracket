![day-3.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-3.jpg)

**Winner: Mi-del Ginger Snaps. I picked the non-trash cookie!**

Keebler Fudge Stripes scoring
- smell:  mmmmmm fake chocolate childhood
- first bite: whoaaaaaa nostalgia kicking in here. slightly shortbread cookie but wow the chocolate really kicks in towards the end. like getting hit with a chocolate hammer
- second bite: strong sugar connotations happening. losing the cookie undertones and leading with the  chocolate hammer
- dipping in beverage: eh? this cookie disintegrates pretty fast. hold it under too long and you get soggy mess. not enough and it doesn’t really change anything about the cookie.
- last bite: ok I don’t think this is a shortbread cookie. it’s just… cookie? does it have flavor or is it only a vehicle for chocolate drizzle? those shady keebler elves pushing their chocolate crack on the children.
- fingers: this chocolate def melts in your hand AND your mouth. gotta put it down a lot to keep the fingers clean. though if you like licking chocolate from said fingers, have I got a cookie for you.

Mi-del Ginger Snaps scoring
- smell: mmmmmm spices and ginger and yummy winter smells
- first bite: solid crunch factor, though it could stand to be a bit softer. excellent ginger flavors, just a hint of other spices (I dunno spices dont make me look it up).
- second bite: happy happy cookie dance for meeeeeee. starts to get a smidge of heat from the spices which is so cozy and warm.
- dipping in beverage: heyo softer cookie! not too much or you get soggy cookie and that texture is vomit
- last bite: not gonna lie, this is a quality cookie. may even make it to the top of The Way of the Cookie Cult.
- fingers: clean clean clean fingers
