## Day 13: Tim Tams vs Stauffers Animal Crackers

![day-13.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-13.jpg)

Winner: Tim Tams. But gotta say, I will freeze these from now on to protect fingers and cookie integrity

Stauffers Animal Cracker scoring:
- smell: I dunno they smell like animal crackers? what is that smell??
- first bite:  ok so slight sugar flavor but very mild, a little bit of butter? basically these are very mild cookies that have some flavor I can’t name.
- second bite: dry cookies need more liquid to combat Sahara Mouth. but also they’re easy to eat.
- dipping in beverage: so these have magical teflon surfaces. to actually absorb the coffee, you must first piece the outer shell and expose the guts of the animal. which then immediately turns to a soggy mess. the outer shell has been forged over many generations of evolution.
- last bite: ok so while these are not the most thrilling cookies, I could eat them all day and not have my teeth rot from my skull. so there’s that.
- fingers: the cleanest fingers you ever did see

Tim Tams scoring:
- smell: CHOCOLATE IN YO FACE
- first bite:  very chocolatey outside with a satisfying crunch on the inside. kinda seems like those wafer cookies? but then doused in fudge.
- second bite: oooo now I can taste the fudge between the wafer layers, it makes the wafers slide around in your mouth after eating. which is frankly a very weird sensation.
- dipping in beverage: ewwwww so gross. it becomes this gooey chocolate sludge. also part of it fell off and now my coffee is contaminated.
- last bite: ok so this kinda becomes a mess after a bit. like my fingers are gross, the cookie starts to melt everywhere, it falls apart in my mouth sliding all over the place. but it is quality chocolate so it’s got that.
- fingers: CHOCOLATE ON YOUR FINGERS. do you know how long this took to type as I have to only use one hand? these are messy messy cookies.
