![day-7.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-7.jpg)

**Winner: Chocolate Chip! Canada reigns supreme.**

Hello Panda scoring:
- smell:  very very faint sugar smell but also I had to put my nose right on it so basically they don’t smell.
- first bite: I tried to bite it in half but I think most of the creamy middle is in the other half. sads.
- second bite: popped a whole new one in my mouth for full experience. now I get the chocolate cream but it’s mild.
- dipping in beverage: terrible mushy goo cookie and now the middle cream is trying to slide OUT of the cookie. thats terrible.
- last bite: I approve of all the fun things about these cookies: the packaging, the cartoon shapes, the stamped pandas, the inside full of cream. sadly the cookie itself doesn’t taste very fun.
- fingers: clean as a whistle.

President’s Choice Chocolate Chip scoring:
- smell:  ooooo very chocolatey smells. my mouth is excited
- first bite: alright this is a primo chocolate chip cookie. the chocolate tastes expensive? or at least doesn’t taste fake.
- second bite: I am digging this cookie. yes it’s a bit dry as it’s a hard cookie and not soft, but daaaaaaang this chocolate is very very nice. hold on i’m gonna give one to the swede to see how it fares with the Expensive and European TasteBuds. The Swede says, “huh thats a pretty good cookie” which for him is high praise unless it’s salted licorice powder and then he loses his damn mind.
- dipping in beverage: eh, I just don’t like most cookies dunked in milk. soggy cookies are gross.
- last bite: There’s a reason CCCookies are so popular and this cookie is one of the reasons.
- fingers:  fingers get pretty crumby but it doesn’t stick.
