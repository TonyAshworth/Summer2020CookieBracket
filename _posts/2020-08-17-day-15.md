![day-15.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-15.jpg)

Winner: Lorna Doone Shortbread Cookie!

Keebler Deluxe Grahams scoring:
- smell: snorting chocolate is wonderful
- first bite:  another crumby cookie! my floor is gonna need a vaccuum after this. ok so strong chocolate flavors, but the graham cracker kinda falls apart right away in my mouth.
- second bite: ok so the graham cracker isnt actually a graham cracker. it feels like it should crunch but does not crunch. it smooshes when bitten into. weird.
- dipping in beverage: just gets mooshier. do not like.
last bite: ultimately I want more crunch here. too squishy no crispy crunch as graham crackers should have.
- fingers: as long as you dont hold them too long, fingers stay clean. otherwise it starts to melt and contaminate your fingers.

Lorna Doone Shortbread Cookie scoring:
- smell: ooooo very buttery smell. exciting!
- first bite:  oooooo nice, very nice. excellent buttery cookie, not too sweet but def a hint of sugar. fairly crumbly and now my desk is dirty. and now my floor is dirty cause I brushed it off my desk. now my cat is sniffing the crumbs.
- second bite: this is a happy cookie. yes a bit dry to be fair, but it would go so well with a coffee or a tea.
- dipping in beverage: actually holds up pretty well with milk. not that I think it improves the cookie but it shockingly did not turn into mush.
- last bite: this is a quality cookie I could eat all day AND is a special treat! welcome to Heather’s Brain Logic, you’re welcome
- fingers: pretty crumby
