- just cookie: oh hey its a chocolate cookie and it is so yummy, I will do a dance in my chair for the yummy choco cookie in my mouths
- just filling:  just some straight up vanilla in yo face. actually now that I think about it, is it vanilla? or is it just sugar? eats more think it’s just sugar. cool.

Mint Oreo scoring:
- smells: yassss thin mints here we come
- first bite: nomnomnom mint and chocolate is the best combo everrrrrr I love it so
- just cookie: weirdly after a bite of the mint it takes a really long time for my mouth to taste the chocolate all by itself. maybe the mint breaks my mouth? dont care
- just filling:  don’t careeeeee SO MINTY AND WONDERFUL. actually its a bit like eating toothpaste by itself, it does need the chocolate. also dang my house is hot and these are kinda melty.
- dipped in beverage: please see above. milk, you are an abomination.
- last bite:  thin mints. all. year. long. why do you keep asking the dumb questions?
