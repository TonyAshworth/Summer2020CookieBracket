![day-10.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-10.jpg)

Winner: Mint Oreos. Though it was closer than I thought it would be.

Birthday Cake Oreo
- smells: whoaaaa this smells exactly like frosting from the can. like intense. the smell alone just spiked my blood sugar.
- first bite: eating frosting. I am legit eating frosting from the can and the cookie is just a spoon to eat more frosting.
- just cookie: standard oreo cookie. I don’t know why I expect these to be different.
- just filling:  all at once is a bad idea. I repeat DANGER WILL ROBINSON. my mouth is freakin out! no wait, it’s subsiding, we’re all good here.
- dipped in beverage: milk makes it too sweet though coffee does help tone it down. pick your beverage wisely.
- last bite: the frosting did start to grow on me but ultimately it’s too much.

Mint Oreo
- smells: minty fresh goodness. nommmmmmm smells like a thin mint
- first bite:  solid minty flavor which is excellent, very much like a mint chocolate chip ice cream which I love.
- just cookie: stop. expecting. cookies. to. taste. different. heather.
- just filling:  why doesnt it taste as strong minty flavor when it’s all alone? did it break? is the mint in the cookie? it cant be because I JUST ATE THE COOKIE.
- dipped in beverage: meh, I just dont like oreos in milk. leave my cookies alone!
- last bite: mint and chocolate go together like ….. queso and chips? I dunno, i’m riding the sugar wave let me enjoy the moment.
