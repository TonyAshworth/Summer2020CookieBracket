![day-4.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-4.jpg)

**Winner: Carrot Cake Oreo**

Double Stuffed scoring
- first bite: awwww yeah. classic oreo in my mouths. I feel such nostalgia for SE Asia right now.
- just cookie: solid chocolate cookie. nothing fancy but doesn’t need to be.
- just filling: holy poo on toast this is a sugar rush. also I forgot my knife and I had to be a heathen and scrape it off with my teeth.
- dipped in beverage: unpopular opinion that oreos do not improve dipped in milk. soggy mess.
- last bite: ok double stuff might be too much. chugging water to handle the sugar rush. I prefer a normal oreo but minus one cookie aka an openfaced oreo aka a REO.

Carrot Cake scoring
- first bite: whoaaaaaa what is happening here? ok we got the spicyness of the carrot cake, then the cream cheese filling, then something else? just sugar? IM SO CONFUSED AND EXCITED ABOUT THIS
- just cookie: this cookie is much harder than normal oreos but it took me awhile to believe it was different texture not just flavor. very crunchy cookie! spicy flavors but not as strong as the first bite. it’s kinda like a very mild ginger snap omg yes thats it, this cookie takes a long time to understand.
- just filling: this is exactly cream cream frosting and I should not have put the whole thing in my mouth at once. its TOO MUCH. also it has some minor underlying flavor I can’t nail down. I think it’s whatever makes the frosting hold it’s shape and so some fake thing? I dunno. I need a bucket of water right now.
- dipped in beverage: oooo dipping in coffee is quite good. bitterness of coffee tones down the sugar of the frosting which is really nice.
- last bite: agree that this 100% tastes like carrot cake. only complaint is the cookie to filling ratio. needs more spicy cookie! so really I need an OREOO :slightly_smiling_face:
