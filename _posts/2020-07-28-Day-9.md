![day-9.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-9.jpg)

**Winner: Pocky! Masaki’s mind games emerge victorious**

Presidents Choice White Chocolate Chip Cookie scoring:
- smell:  a mild cocoa smell. should I make a cup of hot cocoa to go with this cookie?
- first bite: ok so a slight chocolate cookie with crunchy bits in it. i’m not sure i actually taste the white chocolate chip
- second bite: yep this is a chocolate cookie, not a chocolate chip cookie.
dipping in beverage: oh no this cookie disintegrated on liquid contact. it is the Gremlin of cookies.
- last bite: my brain breaks thinking of the other President Cookie and how much I loved it. Can’t help but think of Washington vs Adams administration. #ham4ham
- fingers: these are the most dusty crumbly cookies. Must eat over plate and have napkin available. or yoga pants, no judgement here.

Pocky scoring:
- smell:  strongggg chocolate smells. and no I did not shove the stick up my nose.
- first bite:  oh this is kinda fun. solid chocolate flavor, much stronger than I would have expected. nice crunch of the stick.
- second bite: these taste much better than I thought they would. plus fun stick factor so I can pretend it’s a wand, lightsaber, sword, whatever.
- dipping in beverage: while milk doesnt do much for these, the ability to stir my beverage is hilarious and wonderfully adorable.
- last bite: I do love the ability to play with my food. these are tasty cookie treats with a strong fun factor.
- fingers: clean clean stick fingers.
