## We're going to be playing catch up for a bit here.

The cookie bracket is already in full swing and we're going to spend some time this week getting the pages created for the reviews that already happened but at the very least we are going to start by saying welcome to this new endeavor to entertain ourselves.

Heather again will be our judge and jury and gets the final say of what cookies make it past each round and which ones will fall by the wayside.

So pardon our dust while we get the website into full swing but we'll hopefully have some content for you shortly!
