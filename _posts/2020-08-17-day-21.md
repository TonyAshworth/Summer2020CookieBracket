Winner:  Dutch Butter Cookies! Do I have to give away the losers? they’re not losers! they’re just 2nd place!

Pocky scoring:
- smell: oooo quality chocolate, not too sweet
- first bite:  dark chocolate with a slight hint of vanilla from the cookie stick I think. a nice crunch though!
- second bite: I want to pretend im smoking a cigarette with these like those sugar candy cigarettes from when we were kids? which is a terrible thing for kids but also…. playing with your food is fun!
- dipping in beverage: coffee stir stick! practical applications that the swede can’t complain about!
- last bite: ultimately the dark chocolate hurt these as I’m not a huge fan of the dark chocolate. sorry pocky fans.
- fingers: cleaner than clean

Dutch Butter Cookies scoring:
- smell: mmmmmm butter and sugar! two terrible things for you that taste like mmmmmmm
- first bite:  slightly sweet cookie with a crunchy layer of sugar on top and butter undertone. look how fancy I sounded just then! woo! and ruined
- second bite: nomnomnom tasty butter cookie. tasty sugar crunch. nomnomnom
- dipping in beverage: gack no, goes squish city. no thank you.
- last bite: nice simple sugar cookie wins out! I will eat you all day and be very happy.
- fingers: a bit dusty but overall pretty good
