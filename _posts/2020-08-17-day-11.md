![day-11.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/media/day-11.jpg)


Pepperidge Farm Oatmeal Raisin scoring:
- smell: spices and fruit? mostly spices.
- first bite:  ooooooo so much spices! actually more than I would have expected. cookie is a bit softer than I would like, but I love the sweet and salty combo.
- second bite: there are not enough raisins in this cookie.
- dipping in beverage: ewwwww squish city
- last bite: ok this is painful for me because I LOVE oatmeal raisin cookies. like LOVE them. and this is a bad oatmeal raisin cookie. I want to vote for it to continue because I love the type of cookie but I can’t. cause im sad. sad sad cookie tears. I should have bought Tate’s Bakeshop Cookies. Can I call an audible?! :blobsob:
- fingers: clean clean

Dutch Butter Cookies scoring:
- smell: smells like butter! and sugar! as advertised I suppose
- first bite: dry cookie with a hint of sugar on it. kinda like shortbread? but maybe a bit more sweet.
- second bite: slightly more butter flavor now and the sugar is a bit stronger as well.
- dipping in beverage: milk just runs off the cookie so that’s weird. maybe if I really held it under? and then it disintegrated. well that was dumb.
- last bite: ugh fine. you win dutch cookie, though you should lose. you were still tasty.
fingers: pretty crumbly
