Winner: Original Oreo! begone you foul caramel beast.

Caramel Coconut Oreo
- smells: it smells like a Yankee Candle. that sickeningly sweet you cant quite put your finger on the actual smell, you just know it smells way too much.
- first bite: ok it smells much stronger than it tastes. no wait, my tongue was just avoiding the filling. its… something. overly sweetened caramel? I really dont know what its doing.
- just cookie: bless you standard oreo cookie for maintaining your innocence in this monstrosity
- just filling:  oh god oh god oh god I dont want to…. nonononononononoNONO what is this?! why??? its crunchy! its crunchy filling that tastes like you made cotton candy out of caramel, drizzled that with coconut shavings, then distilled the whole thing down to pure syrup, boiled that for 3 days to intensify the flavors and then made frosting out of that. NO.
- last bite: no. this is an abomination. I hate you Oreo.

Original Oreo
- smells: safe chocolately zone. bless you OGREO.
- first bite: awww yeah these are the good stuff. takes me back to Laos, good times good times.
- just cookie: hello chocolate goddess. welcome back to my mouf.
- just filling:  I will never doubt the quality of your standard oreo filling again. you are manna from cookie heaven.
- last bite: do a little dance. eat a little cookie. get down tonight. woo! get down with your oreos tonight!
