**Winner: Stroopwafels!**

Stroopwafels scoring
- smell: whoa opening the box smelled just like I was pouring syrup all over the counter
- first bite: huh I would have actually expected it to be much more maple syrup than it is. nope, there it goes.
- second bite: ok im just eating a pancake in cookie form. its now a warm waffle dripping with syrup. which is hella good but also my brain be breaking.
dipping in beverage: nope that was not a good combo with coffee. the bitterness does not do well with the syrupness.
- last bite: my cookie is drying out? going cold? getting more crumbly and I keep dropping bits on my lapcat.
fingers: slight crumbs but not bad. warming over coffee I think actually softened it and stopped the crumbs. interesting.

Lemon cookies scoring
- smell: very slight lemony vibe but I had to stick my nose on it, so now its contaminated
- first bite: awww yeah this is a quality cookie. very crispy with that excellent crystallized sugar crunch but not as much lemon as I would want.
- second bite: getting more lemon happening now, but itâ€™s still small. mostly crunchy sugar.
- dipped in beverage: a coffee dunk actually tones down the sugar, which is good! highly suggest.
- last bite: excellent cookie which I would happily eat again. however it never reached the lemon vibe I want.
fingers: whoa this is a crumbly cookie. I keep having to brush my fingers over the plate to control the little cookie bits.
